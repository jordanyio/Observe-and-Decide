# Predictive Analytics for Credit Card Customer Segmentation and Approval

## Introduction

This project aims to employ predictive analytics to achieve strategic customer segmentation and make informed decisions on credit card approvals. It utilizes two distinct datasets: Predicting Credit Card Customer Segmentation and Credit Card Approval Prediction, to develop models that enhance customer service and operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- **Customer Segmentation**: To segment the credit card customer base to identify valuable customers and tailor services accordingly.
- **Credit Card Approval Prediction**: To predict the approval status of credit card applications using machine learning models, improving decision-making processes.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis and model building steps.

## Datasets

1. **Customer Segmentation Dataset**: Includes customer demographics, spending behavior, and transaction data.
2. **Credit Card Approval Dataset**: Contains applicant's personal information, financial history.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleaning: Removing outliers, handling missing values.
- Transformation: Normalizing and encoding features for model compatibility.

### Model Development

- Employing clustering techniques for customer segmentation.
- Utilizing classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for approval prediction.

### Evaluation

- Prediction model performance assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Results

- Achieved distinct customer segments with tailored marketing strategies.
- Improved accuracy in predicting credit card approval, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
